Welcome to the documentation for hsmmlearn!
===========================================

``hsmmlearn`` is a library for unsupervised learning of hidden semi-Markov
models with explicit durations. It is a port of the hsmm_ package for R written
by Jan and Ingo Bulla. In fact, the C++ code that powers hsmmlearn comes
verbatim from hsmm.
